 * project exports byte-identically on a fast machine and a slow one, and
 * frame `i` of the export is the same pose as scrubbing the preview to
 * `i / fps` (§4, §14 trap 5).
 *
 * The last frame sits one frame *before* `duration`, not on it: a 2s clip at
 * 30fps is 60 frames covering 0..59/30, and including t = duration would
 * duplicate the loop point.

 *
 * The frames are stored, not deflated. PNG is already compressed; asking
